### Description
The repository comprises R syntax and shell scripts designed for a simulation study that evaluates the performance of Stacked Penalized Logistic Regression (StaPLR; Van Loon et al., 2020) in combination with meta-level imputation methods.

The study explores the performance of StaPLR under varying conditions of missingness, utilizing four different meta-level imputation methods, as well as Complete Case Analysis and Complete Data Analysis. The evaluation focuses on view selection performance and prediction accuracy.

The R syntax is written for use in a cluster computer system (SLURM HPC cluster).

Note that the majority of the R syntaxes have been adapted from the work of Wouter van Loon and are closely related to the studies conducted and reported in Van Loon et al. (2020 & 2022). For original R syntaxes and the 'multiview' package for utilizing StaPLR with multi-view structured data, please refer to the following repository:

### Instruction for Running the Simulation in R in a cluster computer environment

Two types of documents are provided: The first type are the R syntaxes (.R files), which provide the code for R to run the simulations and return the output in a file saved in the cluster computer environment used. The second type are shell scripts (.txt files) which are needed to assign the tasks of the R syntax to the available nodes of the cluster computer system. Running one of the shell scripts initializes the process of running the according R Syntax.

Note that the R syntaxes and shell scripts must be adjusted (see below) and the required R packages downloaded to the cluster computing environment before using them. The required adjustments include the following parts:

  - Source code for use of functions and other R objects (e.g., 'source("/ ... /MVS.R")') ->  Assign the correct folder and file name containing the needed function or object

  - File name for saving the results -> assign the correct repository

  - shell scripts -> Check if assigned memory is sufficient. If not, increase slightly and try again.
