# missingness_overlap_StaPLR

### Description

This repository provides R syntax for a simulation study comparing the performance of StaPLR (Stacked Penalized Logistic Regression), a method for predicting a binary outcome when using multi-view structured data, when missing values occur in multiple views by row. Imputation methods are applied on the feature level (random forest & mean imputation) and the meta level (meta mean imputation, etc.) and compared with each other in respect to prediction accuracy, computation time, and view selection. The comparison also includes the performance under complete case analysis and complete data analysis. The R syntax is written for use in a cluster computer system (SLURM HPC cluster). 

Note that all syntaxes are modified versions of the original R syntaxes creaty by Wouter van der Laan and relate to the study conducted and reported in Wouter et al. (2020). The repository to the original R syntaxes and package for using StaPLR with multi-view structured data can be found here:

### Manual for Running the Simulation in R in a cluster computer environment

This repository contains two type of documents. The first type are the R syntaxes (.R files), which provide the code for R to run the simulations and return the output in a file saved in the cluster computer environment used. The second type are batch scripts (.txt files) which are needed to assign the tasks of the R syntax to the available nodes of the cluster computer system. To run one of the R syntaxes the batch files are used to initialize the process.

Note that before personal use of the R syntaxes and batch scripts, both must be adjusted and the required R packages downloaded to the cluster computing environment. The required modifications include the following parts:

  - Source code for use of functions and other R objects (e.g., 'source("/home/.../MVS.R")') -->  Assign the correct folder and file name containing the needed function or object

  - File name for saving the results --> assign the correct repository

  - batch scripts --> Check if assigned memory is sufficient. If not, increase slightly and try again.
